Purpose
---

This branch is dedicated to testing the performance of LLM models, which were pre-trained on CAD datasets, to generate a parametric command sequence of CAD instructions like:

1. Sketch 
2. Circle(center=0,0,r=30) 
3. Extrude(height=100)
4. Cut(handle)


TO-DO list:
---

- test Cadrille: [Multi-modal CAD Reconstruction (2025)](https://github.com/col14m/cadrille)
- test CAD-Llama (2025)
